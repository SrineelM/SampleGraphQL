# --- Production Profile (Activated when spring.profiles.active=prod) ---
# This file contains settings specifically for a live production environment.
# It prioritizes security, performance, and stability over developer convenience.

# Production environment configuration.
# Secure settings for production deployment, real DB, and secrets.

      # Database schema changes should be managed explicitly with a migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase.
